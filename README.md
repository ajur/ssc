Diving into gamedev with TypeScript and PIXI.js


## Credits

If not stated otherwise in [credits](#credits), all artwork, sounds and code is done by me.

One can check all used libs and stuff in package.json, but special thanks goes to [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/) team, for their awesome renderer,
and [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/) for GSAP.

And ofcourse, to awesome webdev and gamedev comunities for abundance of free resources, tutorials, tips and tools.
